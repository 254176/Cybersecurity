To get the password I would first look at the entire list given to me in the /etc/shadow file. I would then see if it is a MD5, Blowfish, 
SHA-256, or SHA-512 hash printed as a hexa-decimal string. I would get these hexadecimal strings by using Pythonâ€™s hash-lib library 
which can encode passwords into MD5, Blowfish, SHA-256, or SHA-512 hash. I can then use hexdigest() to convert the encoded 
data into a hexadecimal string. The only password which matched the MD5, Blowfish, SHA-256, or SHA-512 format was : philip-kocher.
