As being a part of FBI I can:

- I can use the linux databse to get a list of all possible passwords and then try to trick the criminal, and then see if there are any encrypted emails.Then to get the proof of the email encryption I would have to
look at the foundation of the email which is basically code. If the code is valid, then the email is encrypted. This can tell you whether there is a proffessional behind the email encryption. This proffessinal coder behind it 
is the guy the Kocher is basically supporting by getting these encrypted emails. Therefore, now I would tell the judge that Kocher is receving encrypted emails and is therefore supporting 
the hacker or cyber criminal.
