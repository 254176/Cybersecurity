Week 1
As being a part of the FBI I can:
Search Online File Sharing Networks since the ideal spots for child pornography are these networks since it is more open and content can be shared easily.  
Use Online Personas to make sure that the criminal does not figure out that I am a part of the FBI and erases the proof. 
Subpoena Users' Personal Information by asking service providers to give personal identifiable information based on their actions on their website. 
Obtain Search and Seizure Warrants so that I can force the criminal to investigate his posessions and then try to get actual physical evidence of the crime. 
Obtain Forensic Analyses of Electronics so that I can know better about the actual crime committed and put the right people into suspicion respectively. 
Question Suspects and Others so that I can know there backing on whether they commited the crime. Also I can look at their reactions when the questions are asked and then try to determine whether they are lying and interrogate them respectively. Eventually I will get a confession.
